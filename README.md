# USDA Data Visualization and Analytics Team SAIC Prototype: SNAP-MAP

[Prototype repository and documentation](https://github.com/metrostarsystem/usda-dva)

# Prototype Overview
The goal of our **SNAP-MAP and Dashboard** is to improve accessibility for 43 million SNAP users, which currently find eligible retailers via a FLASH-Based map with Zip Files (inaccessible for most modern browsers and smart phones). To improve the voice of the customer (VoC) and customer understanding, we also identified areas to integrate the data into actionable insights for USDA stakeholders.

## SNAP-MAP & Dashboard
**SNAP-MAP** focuses on increasing Customer Experience (CX) for millions of citizens who use the SNAP program to feed their families. SNAP-MAP unifies three core data sets around farmers markets, retailers, and SNAP office locations. The result provides citizens with timely, accessible, and trustworthy resources. 

**Dashboard** improves and expands data in meaningful ways, and can be used by the Secretary’s staff to create rapid, meaningful discussion for the VoC by pulling data across multiple data sets identified in our research. Citizens’ feedback provided via “Tell Sonny” fuels the dashboard with real-time content and enables continuous feedback.

# Digital Services Playbook

Our team followed the Digital Service playbook guideline as described in the link below:

[Alignment to Digital Services Playbook](https://github.com/metrostarsystem/usda-dva/blob/master/documentation/usds-playbook.md)

## 1. Assign a Leader
We assigned one leader, our Project Manager – Senior (PM), Jason Stoner, who had the authority, responsibility, and was held accountable for the quality of our SNAP-MAP prototype and Dashboard Mockup. He was also responsible for defining the initial prototype concept and backlog priorities.

## 2. Assemble a Team
The SAIC Team built a prototype that met the requirements for the BPA to leverage data-sets from Data.gov, Social Media, and USDA web properties. We also included a solution that captured elements from Task Order 1, 2, and 3. We assembled a multidisciplinary team using 7 of the 18 labor categories LCATs and hours are outlined below:
- 0003A UX /Graphics Designer (10 hours)
- 0003D Web Designer (80 hours)
- 0003E Web Developer (80 hours)
- 0001B Project Manager- Senior (who served as our Product Manager) (6.5 hours)
- 0001C Scrum Master (10 hours)
- 0002B Data Analyst – Senior (30 hours)
- 0002A Data Analyst - Junior (60 hours)

## 3.  Understand Users
To understand our users, we developed **user personas**, **user stories**, and **user journeys**, which were integrated as part of our overarching **Human-Centered Design** (HCD) process described in more detail below.

## 4. HCD Process
We leveraged four core HCD techniques: 1) **Business Model Generation**, 2) **Lean UX**, 3) **HCD**, 4) **Agile Development**

## 5. Styles and Patterns
To ensure consistency and reduce redundancy while developing the prototype, our team leveraged the [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) and the [USDA Digital Style Guide](https://www.usda.gov/media/digital/digital-style-guide). These resources enabled us to incorporate the best practices and ensure accessibility was built in from the beginning.

## 6. Application Stack 
We developed SNAP-MAP with 9 **open source** technologies: **angular-cli, angular, node, leaflet, sqlite3, ngx-smart-modal, uswds, typescript, expressjs**

## 7. Usability Tests
We conducted usability tests to **evaluate**, **iterate**, and **improve** our prototype by testing it on users. This is a vital usability practice, since it informs direct input on how actual users are interacting with the system.

## 8.  Iterate
Our team needed to move quickly and make informed decisions. To do this, we leveraging **agile scrum** to rapidly identify gaps and areas for improvement without delaying progress.

## 9. Responsive Design
Our SNAP-MAP prototype works on multiple devices and is a responsive design. We implemented our front-end with the USWDS (U.S. Web Design System) to provide a completely responsive experience. We conducted **usability tests** to observe users on these platforms and used Google’s chrome **mobile display test tool** to emulate the experience of different platforms.

## 10. Installation
Please reference [install.md](https://github.com/metrostarsystem/usda-dva/blob/master/documentation/install.md)

## 11. Open Source Licenses
We used a variety of open source tools to build our prototype.
