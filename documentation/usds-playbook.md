# Alignment to U.S. Digital Services Playbook
We used the U.S. Digital Services Playbook as a framework to guide the development of our prototype. 


# Play 1: Understand What People Need

To understand the needs of our users, we developed **user personas** and **user stories** to identify how our prototype and dashboard can make their lives easier.

We developed a **user journey map** To address how our users would find, interact with, and recommend the services available in our prototype. 

# Play 3 Make it Simple and Intuitive

To build a prototype that enables our users to succeed the first time, we used the [U.S. Web Design System Components and Guidelines](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) as the foundation for our prototype.

# Play 4 Build the service using agile and iterative practices

Developing a prototype in less than four weeks required an experienced agile team. We developed a war room, held daily standups, and used tools like **Slack**, **SharePoint Online**, **Kanban**, and **GitHub** to ensure incremental development and maintain a fast pace. 

# Play 5 Structure Budgets and Contracts to Support Delivery
Not applicable, as this prototype was developed as a response to the USDA and GSA IT Modernization IT Centers of Excellence Digital Visualization and Analytics BPA. 

# Play 6 Assign One Leader and Hold That Person Accountable

**Our Product Manager - Senior (Product Owner) is Jason Stoner.**

He unified the team by facilitating ideation and design activities that allowed us to identify the users and scope of the prototype. He also had the final authority when pivots needed to be made. 

Jason Stoner has 15+ years leading digital teams. His experience spans the entire UX process for web and mobile projects from client interaction and collaboration, data collection, user and task analysis, information architecture, visual design, metrics, and analysis based on targeted user research.

# Play 7 Bring in Experienced Teams

Our prototype team has day-to-day responsibilities delivering superior digital projects to high-profile federal customers. Each member of the team has supported contracts, which required digital resources to design and develop web and mobile solution, data strategy, DevOps, automation, continuous integration, and compliance with federal mandates including Section 508. 

# Play 8 Choose a Modern Technology Stack

We used a modern application stack to build the prototype.  That stack includes: 
We developed SNAP-MAP with 9 modern, **open source** technologies most appropriate to implement the prototype: **angular-cli, angular, node, leaflet, esri-leaflet, ngx-smart-modal, uswds, typescript, expressjs**

# Play 9 Deploy in a Flexible Hosting Environment

Our hosting environment is **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**.

# Play 10 Automate Testing and Deployments

We assessed the logic behind our SNAP-MAP prototype and felt that unit testing and basic automation for deployment was the right economic/cost balance. As a team, we focused on understanding the BPA and Task Orders and our MVP prototype vs. what a production level solution would require in terms of an automated testing framework to help test automation code across: **Reusability, Maintainability, and Stability**. For example, asking what would the cost of a framework leveraging **Serenity** to act as the wrapper on top of **Selenium** would be for this MVP vs. Unit Testing. 

We also wrote **Windows Batch** scripts for deploying our prototype and leveraged others across our company to take our solution and test how fast they can deploy the solution in the same **AWS environment with over 95% success rate**.
