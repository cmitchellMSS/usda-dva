# Alignment to U.S. Digital Services Playbook
We used the U.S. Digital Services Playbook as a framework to guide the development of our prototype. 

# Play 1: Understand What People Need
To understand the needs of our users, we developed **user personas** and **user stories** to identify how our prototype and dashboard can make their lives easier. 

[User Stories](https://            )
[User Personas](https://  )
# Play 2: Make it Simple and Intuitive
We developed a **user journey map** To address how our users would find, interact with, and recommend the services available in our prototype. 
# Play 3 Make it Simple and Intuitive
To build a prototype that enables our users to succeed the first time, we used the [U.S. Web Design System Components and Guidelines](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) as the foundation for our prototype.
# Play 4 Build the service using agile and iterative practices
Developing a prototype in less than four weeks required an experienced agile team. We developed a war room, held daily standups, and used tools like **Slack**, **Kanban**, and **GitHub** to ensure incremental development and maintain a fast pace. 
# Play 5 Structure Budgets and Contracts to Support Delivery
Not applicable, as this prototype was developed as a response to the USDA and GSA IT Modernization IT Centers of Excellence Digital Visualization and Analytics BPA. 
# Play 6 Assign One Leader and Hold That Person Accountable
Our Product Manager - Senior (Product Owner) is Jason Stoner.

He unified the team by facilitating ideation and design activities that allowed us to identify the users and scope of the prototype. He also had the final authority when pivots needed to be made. 

Jason Stoner has 15+ years leading digital teams. His experience spans the entire UX process for web and mobile projects from client interaction and collaboration, data collection, user and task analysis, information architecture, visual design, metrics, and analysis based on targeted user research. 
# Play 7 Bring in Experienced Teams
Our prototype team has day-to-day responsibilities delivering superior digital projects to high-profile federal customers. Each member of the team has supported contracts, which required digital resources to design and develop web and mobile applications, DevOps, automation, continuous integration, and compliance with federal mandates including Section 508. 
# Play 8 Choose a Modern Technology Stack
We used a modern application stack to build the prototype.  That stack includes: 
We developed SNAP-MAP with X modern, **open source** technologies most appropriate to implement the prototype: **angular-cli, angular, node, leaflet, esri-leaflet, ngx-smart-modal, uswds, typescript, expressjs**
# Play 9 Deploy in a Flexible Hosting Environment
Our hosting environment is **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**.
