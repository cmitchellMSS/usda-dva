# User Personas
Personas are fictional representations we use to reflect who are target users are, their unique needs, and how they'll interact with our prototype. Personas are developed (at a high level) by: 
- Identifying and researching target users
- Developing a hypothesis
- Describing the context around the challenges they need to overcome
- Making continuous adjustments
