# User Stories
User stories enable us to put people first by providing context around why certain features and capabilities are being pursued. User stories also help frame the daily tasks our team commits to aligned to the agile framework. Our user stories enable the team to achieve the following: 

- Focus on the user
- Enable collaboration
- Maintain momentum
- Rapid implementation
- Reduce Risk

We used the [user personas](https://github.com/metrostarsystem/usda-dva/blob/master/documentation/user-personas.md) we developed as part of our Human-Centered Design process as the foundation for our user stories.
