# Human-Centered Design (HCD) & Agile
We use a tailored Human-Centered Design (HCD) process aligned to Agile Scrum.

## Approaches & Methodologies
### Agile Methodology
We use the agile methodology aligned to HCD to deliver tasks against the protoype. This process begins with Discovery (sprint 0) and facilitates iterative development sprints, which build toward the delivered prototype. This also enables consistent feedback loops and designates appropriate lines of authority aligned to the [U.S. Digital Services Playbook.](https://github.com/metrostarsystem/usda-dva/blob/master/documentation/usds-playbook.md)

We use traditional **kanban** boards to design, manage, and visualize workflows.

### Business Model Canvas
**What**: Aligns the organizational strategy and vision, business model, and operating models to ensure the digital products being created are aligned with a future oriented operating model to ensure success.

**Why**:   Ensure the products being creates are well positioned with an agile operating model in today’s disruptive environment.

**How**: There are key characteristics that will shape the mindset, the structure and the economic viability of the organization. They include:
- Infrastructure – Modern technology and infrastructure to accelerate solutions to market
- Team Composition – Bringing passion, purpose and performance together with modern software development best practices
- Relationships – Create flexibility and efficiency through modular building blocks such external API’s and partnerships to provide enhanced content and data

### Cognitive Walkthrough          
**What**: An evaluation method in which people work through a set of representative tasks and ask questions about the task as they go.

**Why**: To get rapid, early feedback on whether a design solution is easy for a new or infrequent user to learn, and why it is or isn’t easy. This method is useful for catching big issues at any stage in the design process when you don’t have access to real users, but it is not a substitute for user evaluation.

**How** Conducted 2 sessions, 1) with the existing SNAP-MAP to see how users navigated the current UI to determine gaps and opportunities for enhancement along with understanding any additional data users would want to see and 2) with the new prototype to see how users would navigate the UI and input data. 

### Stakeholder and User Interviews
  
**What**: A wide-spanning set of semi-structured interviews with anyone who has an interest in a project’s success, including users.

**Why**: To build consensus about the problem statement and research objectives.

**How**: Conducted 2 sessions with the existing SNAP-MAP with 1) identified team Product Owner to create a wish list of requirements and 2) with 3 identified users to align user needs to agency goals. The details were turned into user stories and prioritized with the Product Owners

### Journey Map
 
**What**: A visualization of the major interactions shaping a user’s experience of a product or service.

**Why**: To provide design teams with a bird’s-eye view of a service that helps them see the sequence of interactions that make up a user’s experience including the complexity, successes, pain points, and emotions users experience along the way.

**How**: Identified how users will hear about SNAP locations through their interactions on the new SNAP-MAP to follow-up interactions to keep USDA SNAP top-of-mind

### Heuristic Evaluation   

**What**: A quick way to find common, large usability problems on a website.

**Why**: To quickly identify common design problems that make websites hard to use without conducting more involved user research.

**How**: Conducted 2 evaluations, 1) with the current SNAP-MAP to determine gaps in usability to inform the new prototype and 2) on the UI designs to inform the interactive prototype

###  Personas
   
**What**: User archetypes based on conversations with real people.

**Why**: To ground design in reality by forcing us to consider the goals, behaviors, and pain points of the people affected by our design decisions. Unlike marketing personas based on demographics or marketability, design personas describe how someone accomplishes goals.
**How**:

### Mental Modeling
**What**: A simple reference model that correlates existing and potential interfaces with user behaviors.

**Why**: To help designers anticipate how design decisions might facilitate future behaviors.

**How*: Through the Cognitive walkthroughs, interviews, and personas created basic mental models to inform the wireframes and interactivity.  

### Wireframing

**What** : A simple visual representation of a product or service interface.

**Why**: To prioritize substance and relationships over decoration as you begin defining the solution. Wireframing also gives designers a great opportunity to start asking developers early questions about feasibility and structure.

**How**: Used low fidelity sketches to quickly iterate through ideas and move into Adobe XD to prototype and test interactivity. 

### Usability testing
**What**:  Observation of people attempting to use a product.

**Why**: To learn a given design’s challenges, opportunities, and successes.

**How**: Used Top level task analysis and Tobii X2-60 Eye Tracking machine to validate business and design decisions with 3 users. We were able to verify efficiency of UI layout and ability to recover of error to reduce friction points.
